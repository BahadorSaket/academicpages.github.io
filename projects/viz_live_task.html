                    MATLAB</a> is an environment that allows users to write and run their scripts in an executable
                notebook (similar to Jupyter notebook). To create charts in Live Editor in MATLAB users need to write
                scripts. But, according to our customers the current process of creating charts in the Live Editor is
                rather cumbersome, time-consuming, and occasionally error-prone. <br><br>

                To address this challenge, we designed <mark>Create Plot Live Task</mark>, an interactive tool for
                discovering and building charts rapidly. Create Plot Live task is an interactive graphical user
                interface that can be embedded to the Live Editor in MATLAB. Customers can use Create Plot live task to
                interactively create a variety of charts and explore their data. <mark>Create Plot live task is
                    currently integrated to the MATLAB software.</mark>

            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p> Live Editor in MATLAB is an environment that enables MATLAB users to write and run their scripts in
                an executable notebook as shown below. It allows users to create and share documents
                that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. MATLAB customers use Live Editor
                for live data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning
                and much more. MATLAB users create a variety of charts to visualize and make sense of
                their data. This is an iterative process and users frequently create a variety of visualizations
                to explore different aspects of their data. <mark>To create charts in Live Editor users need to write
                    lines of codes and this process is rather cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. </mark>

                To address this challenge, our team worked on designing <mark>Create Plot Live Task</mark>, an
                interactive graphical user interface for discovering and building charts rapidly. Our goal was to design
                an interface that can be embedded to the Live Editor in MATLAB. The underying idea is to combine
                graphical user interfaces with live scripts.The figure below indicates how the
                Create Plot live task can be embedded to the Live Editor to improve user experience in creating charts.

                Before starting the project, I held meetings with our cross-functional team to discuss important topics, including customer challenges and feedback on existing issues with Live Editor's visual data exploration. We established project goals, research questions, and deadlines during these meetings. These discussions helped me better understand our potential users, objectives, and expected deliverables

            Based on the guidelines created by our team as well as some of our findings, the UX designer in our team
            created multiple different low-fidelity prototypes. During one of our meeting, we discussed the design
            alternatives proposed by our designer. Among the design alternatives considered during our design process,
            one of the designs best met the challenges initially encountered by the customers. However, the design
            needed some additional adjustments. After finalizing the design alternative that we had in mind, our
            engineering team implemented the design and prepared the infrastructure we needed for conducting the
            usability testing. <br><br>

            <h6>Usablity Testing</h6>
            <p class="para-text">To evaluate our design, we used both think-aloud observation and interview methods,
                <mark><i>1) to understand our customers' processes, 2) to measure their success rate and overal
                        experience, 3) to identify different approaches our customer take to discover our feature, and
                        4) to reveal barries of using our feature.</i></mark> We recruited five of our external
                customers with different backgrounds including neuroscience, mechanical engineering, computer science,
                and electrical engineering. All studies were conducted remotely. We screen- and audio-recorded the whole
                study.</p> <br />


            <h6><span>Discoverability of our feature</span></h6>
            <p>We first briefied our participants about the purpose of our study and their rights. We also explained our
                participants the main goal that our feature was trying to accomplish. We then asked our participants:
                <mark><i>''What would you do to find this feature in MATLAB?'' </i></mark> At this stage, we wanted to
                identify different approaches our participants might take and words/vocabulary they might use to find
                our feature. <br /><br />

                When we initially started this project, we aimed to call this feature "Visualize Live Task". But, after
                conducting our study we noticed that majority of our customers used the terms "plot" and "creating plot"
                to search for our feature. As a result of these observations, we decided to change the name of this
                feature to "Create Plot Task" going forward. Our another observation was that four participants tried to
                open our feature by typing "plot" or "chart" keywords in Live Editor. He then mentioned: <mark><i> "I
                        will probably type plot to see what options the system gives me. Auto completion is a good way
                        to cheat on new methods [features]"</i></mark>. Based on our findings, we also added an
                auto-complete feature that allows users to open the feature by typing keywords related to plot,
                charting, visualization (see figure below). </p>

            </ul>

            <h6><span>Customers success rate and experience with our feature</span></h6>
            <p>To measure the participants' success rate and overall experience, we asked them to complete 6 different
                tasks using our feature. Five of the tasks required user to create a new chart or replicate an existing
                chart (e.g., Use the Covid19 dataset to create a bar chart that shows the number of Death per State). We
                also had a task that asked our participants to use our feature to visually explore their data by
                creating as many charts as they want (exploratory analysis). We designed these tasks through an
                iterative process based on several discussions that we had among the team members. Different team
                memebers reviewed the tasks before using them in our actual study. The figure below shows some of the
                tasks we used in our study.

                <p>Overall, our findings showed that all participants were able to complete all tasks without reqiring
                    the facilitator's assistant while performing the tasks. We also got positive feedback about the
                    Create Plot Task feature. This feature made it really easier for people to explore different charts.
                    Our participants constantly selected different charts and made sense of their data from different
                    aspects.​ For example, as one of our participants was exploring different charts, he came across a
                    word cloud visualization and said: <mark><i>"hmmm, Interesting! Is this new? This is pretty cool.
                            Did not know MATLAB enables this [creating word cloud]."</i></mark> Another participant
                    noted: <mark><i>"It is super easy to interactively create charts using this feature."</i></mark>

                    Our observations also showed that it is important to name different visualization parameters
                    appropriately, so that our customers could mentally imagine how they should be specify them while
                    creating charts. For example, in the example below, after selecting the line plot icon, the system
                    asked the participant to specify x and y axes. Here, our participants had an easy time to mentally
                    imagine what x and y prameters mean. See the following figure for more details. ​

                    ​ <ul class="high-fidelity">
                        <li>
                            <img src="../assets/images/mentalmodel1.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    But, what we learned was that the terminology used for some visualization parameters was
                    unfamiliar/unclear to the participants. So, it was hard for our participants to mentally imagine
                    what a particular parameter could mean. ​For instance, the parallel plot was one of those cases
                    where it was hard for our participants to mentally imagine what some of its parameters mean. For
                    example, one of our participants mentioned: <mark><i>"I think terminology of Data and Group threw me
                            off. Groups now makes sense to me, but when I started I was not sure whether data is going
                            to change these things [x labels] or it is going to change my y axis."</i></mark> Our study
                    showed that there were a few cases were participants faced challenges understanding the meaning of
                    the visual channel names. See figure below for more details.
