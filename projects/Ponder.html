            <h6>Project Overview</h6>
                <a href="https://www.clio.com/" target="_blank" class="note-link">Clio</a> offers a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of law firms and legal professionals. 
                <a href="https://www.lawyaw.com/" target="_blank" class="note-link">Lawyaw</a> is the legal document automation software within Clio suite that helps attorneys save time by automating their document creation and management processes. <br><br>

                


                Upon joining the Lawyaw team at Clio, I discovered their slow, error-prone, and inefficient <mark>in-person onboarding process</mark> which incurred a <u>high customer acquisition cost of over $200 per customer</u>. Furthermore, customers felt <u>overwhelmed and rushed during these in-person sessions</u>, struggled to understand product features, and often <u>sought help from customer</u> support, leading to <mark>some churning their subscription</mark>. <br><br>

                As a Product Manager, I successfully oversaw the development and launch of an <mark>intuitive self-serve onboarding</mark> process for the Lawyaw product. As a result of this initiative, we were able to <mark>reduce customer acquisition costs by 70%</mark> and <mark>improve overall customer satisfaction by 62%</mark>.

            <h6>Customer Research</h6>
            <p>
            To begin the project, I held several meetings with our onboarding team as well as our leadership to gain a deeper understanding of our current onboarding process 
            and challenges our team was facing, as well as to learn more about our customers and their backgrounds. 
            I then reviewed feedback and comments from customers about their existing in-person onboarding experiences. Subsequently, I <mark>conducted 11 remote interviews</mark> with customers who underwent Lawyaw's onboarding process in the previous two months. The goal was to identify any pain points or challenges that emerged during the in-person onboarding process for different customer segments. </p>

            <h6><span>Customer Segmentation</span></h6>
            <p>Based on our initial meetings, customer interviews, and their interaction logs, we have categorized our customers into <mark>two primary segments</mark>.</p>

            <p> I conducted remote interviews with recent customers to understand challenges with our existing onboarding process.

                <h6><span>Dogfooding</span></h6>
                <p>
                To ensure that our final product meets the highest quality standards and satisfies the needs of our target audience, I facilitated a dogfooding session where every team member was asked to test the new onboarding process for three days. Moreover, to encourage thorough testing and bug reporting, I introduced a prize for the team member who identified the maximum number of unique bugs and issues. <br><br>

                This strategy served two crucial purposes: <strong>1)</strong> <mark>enabling team members to gain hands-on experience with the new feature</mark> and <strong>2)</strong><mark>providing valuable feedback and insights into potential issues or bugs, which allowed for proactive resolution before launch.</mark>
                </p>
    
                <h6><span>Product Soft Launch</span></h6>
            <p>To ensure that our new onboarding process was effective and ready for a wider release, we conducted a trial with 10 new customers, gathering feedback and testing the product. After the onboarding process, I interviewed each of these customers for 15 minutes to collect their feedback on the experience. Additionally, I checked to ensure that the data we collected during the trial was properly stored in our databases. This allowed us to evaluate the success of the new process and make any necessary adjustments before rolling it out to a larger audience. </p>

                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> <mark>Decrease free trial period to increase sense of urgency:</mark> By decreasing the duration of our free trial period, we can instill a sense of urgency in potential customers and motivate them to take action sooner, resulting in a higher conversion rate and ultimately boosting our revenue.  </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Provide in-person consultation on demand:</mark> A couple of customers expressed concerns about eliminating in-person training altogether. Offering a 30-minute consultation service (if needed) to customers concerned about eliminating in-person training can address their roadblocks and increase satisfaction, while also boosting our conversion rate. </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Enable flexible trial period:</mark> Initially, we had a fixed free trial period of 14 days, but some customers requested an extension due to time constraints preventing them from reviewing all materials in that timeframe. To address this feedback, we provided the sales team with the option to extend the trial session for engaged customers who show a high potential for conversion. By offering this flexibility, we can accommodate the needs of our customers and improve our chances of converting them into paying customers. </li>

            <p>
            On June 7, 2021, we launched our new onboarding process. To gauge the effectiveness of this new feature, we implemented a variety of strategies and utilized different methods to track its success:</p>

                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> <mark>Mixpanel data visualizations:</mark> I used the Mixpanel tool to visualize various metrics over time, including cancellation rate, bounce rate, the quantity of users who requested 1-1 training, and other relevant data points.  </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Fullstory sessions:</mark> I used the FullStory tool to analyze user interactions and identify pain points by observing their behaviors while going through the onboarding process. </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Survey:</mark> Users were prompted to complete a <a href="https://survey.survicate.com/05452484677a0688/?p=anonymous" target="_blank" class="note-link">satisfaction survey</a> to gauge their satisfaction level with their onboarding experience. </li>

                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 04.</span> Effective communication is crucial in cross-functional projects. Product managers must prioritize clear collaboration between teams to ensure everyone understands the goals and their roles.</li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 05.</span> Flexibility is key in cross-functional projects. Product managers should be adaptable, open to feedback, and willing to pivot the project to align with goals while navigating challenges.</li>
