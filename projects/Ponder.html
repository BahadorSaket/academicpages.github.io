            <h6>Project Overview</h6>
            Pandas is a highly popular tool for data science and AI, boasting millions of dedicated users. 
            With its arsenal of over 600 functions, pandas empowers data scientists to efficiently clean, transform, summarize, and featurize data. 
            However, pandas struggles with larger datasets, causing out-of-memory errors and slow performance. As datasets scale, the only viable alternative is to turn to "big data" frameworks like database systems or Spark. 
            Nevertheless, these technologies come with a steep learning curve, particularly for users without a computer science background, necessitating months, if not years, to master. 
            As a result, many data teams continue to prefer using pandas rather than database systems or Spark. <br><br>

            During my time at Ponder, I lead development and launch of <a href="https://ponder.io/product/" target="_blank" class="note-link">Ponder's B2B platform</a>, a technology that allows data teams run pandas anywhere at scale, be it their laptops, clusters, or on the cloud. 
            In particular, Ponder allows data teams to run their pandas code directly in their data warehouse, be it Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift.
            Our MVP launch has attracted a lot of <mark>community attention</mark> and led to the <mark>acquisition of early adopters, POC customers, and paying customers</mark>.

            <h6>Customer and Market Research</h6>
            <p> I conducted extensive customer and market research over a period of several months. Our research involved engaging with more than 100 individual data enthusiasts, data teams from different small and large organizations, as well as leadership at both small and large organizations. 
                We also analyzed the market to gain an understanding of current trends and technologies, as well as their pricing models and target users. 
                Through this comprehensive research process, we were able to gather valuable insights into the needs and preferences of our potential customers, and develop a strategy that meets their unique requirements. </p>

                <h6><span>Customer Segmentation</span></h6>
                <p> One of the main outcomes of our customer research was to better understand the customers landscape and their segments. In particular, we segmented our customers into two distinct groups: 1) <mark>data teams in organizations</mark> and 2) <mark>individual data enthusiasts</mark>.</p>

                <h6 class="variant">Customers pain points</h6>
                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> <mark>Steep Learning Curve:</mark> Many of our participants expressed that one of the major challenges they faced was the difficulty and time-consuming nature of learning "big data" frameworks such as Spark, particularly for junior team members who are just joining the organization. 
                      For example, a data scientist at Shopify said: <i>"I find Spark to be quite challenging and overwhelming, especially when it comes to debugging and optimizing my code for large datasets."</i> 
                      </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Cluster management:</mark> Some of the data teams we spoke with have utilized open-source technologies such as Modin, Dask, and Ray for large data analsyis. However, one of the main challenges that these teams encountered was related to the difficulty in managing clusters they had to created and maintain. </i> 
                        </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Cost management:</mark> Almost all people we talked to have reported challenges managing the costs of their data science workflows that are executed on different clusters. Another customer at an early stage startup mentioned: <i>"The cost of running our data processing jobs on engines like Databricks is becoming increasingly expensive and is impacting our ability to stay within budget."</i></li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 04.</span> <mark>Dependency on team skills:</mark> During our conversations, we learned that some individuals rely on the skill sets of their team members, specifically in SQL or Spark, when it comes to dealing with large data. For instance, a data scientist at Amazon mentioned that they frequently ask their colleague to read data from the database using SQL. However, this often leads to delays in their work as they may have to wait for several hours or face additional communication due to differences in the data obtained.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6><span>Segment Prioritization</span></h6>
                <p>
                    Our research has revealed that the market size for <mark>individual data enthusiasts</mark> is significantly larger than that of data teams in organizations. 
                    Furthermore, in our discussions with many data enthusiasts, we discovered that they had a strong preference for using pandas for their data analysis. 
                    However, we found that this group of customers is not a great fit for our product becuase they typically don't work with big data. Thus, they rarely need a technology to enbale them to scale their workflows. <br><br>
    
                    On the other hand, <mark>data teams in organizations</mark> were the ones that faced many issues scaling their pandas workflows because they often deal with big data.
                    Moreover, they expressed their desire to use our proposed solution on a daily basis and pay for it, as they believe our product can effectively address their current challenges with big data.
                    Based on these findings, we have decided to shift our focus to target data teams in organizations as our primary customer segment.
                     </p>

                     <h6><span>Competitive analysis of well-known tools used for scaling pandas</span></h6>
                     <p>I conducted competitive analysis of well-known libraries and technologies that try to add more power to pandas in various ways. 
                      This helped me and the rest of the team in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and how they stack up against each other.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       <h6 class="variant">Key takeaways from my competitive analysis</h6>
                          <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                              <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> Polars and Vaex require the learning of a new syntax, which can be challenging for some of our customers. This challenge was highlighted during our interviews, indicating that there is still a steep learning curve that needs to be addressed.</li>
                              <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> Even though Modin is drop-in replacement for pandas, it still require users to manage clusters and use Dask or Ray as engine.</li>
                              <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> Mars project is very incomplete. We were not even able to use the library.</li>
                          </ul>
                        
                        In summary, what we learned was that the there is lack of platform that enable users to scale their pandas workflows without having to <mark>manage computing clusters</mark> or <mark>learning a new syntax</mark>.
                        </p>

                      To gain a deeper understanding of our target audience's goals, behaviors, motivations, pain points, and preferences, I created multiple user personas. 
                      These personas helped the team to design a feature that meet users' needs, expectations, and desires. 
                      User personas also help me to communicate with stakeholders by providing a shared understanding of the target users.

                    <p>I then collaborated with the engineering team to create a product timeline to help guide the development and delivery of the product to market. 
                        Timelines and milestones are important aspects of a product roadmap as they provide a clear structure and timeline for the product development process.</p>
