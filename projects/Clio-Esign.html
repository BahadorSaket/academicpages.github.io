            <h6 class="variant">About</h6>
            <p class="variant"> 
                Lawyaw is a powerful legal document automation software that simplifies the document creation process for attorneys. 
                As one of the services offered by the Clio suite, Lawyaw has helped countless legal professionals streamline their workflow and save valuable time. <br><br>

                During my time as a product manager at Clio, I worked with a cross-functional team to develop and launch an eSign feature with the Lawyaw platform. 
                With this new feature, attorneys and parallegals could easily drag and drop signature fields into their documents, making the eSign experience effortless and seamless. 
                What's more, Lawyaw's versatile eSign capabilities allow for the collection of signatures in multiple formats based on specific court requirements, enabling our customers to move projects along at an even faster pace.
                <br>
                My main objectives in this project:
                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                    <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> Achieve a minimum adoption rate of 50% among existing customers and 80% among new customers for the eSign feature.</li>
                    <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> Maintain a daily average of 4000 documents signed using our eSign feature.</li>
                    <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> At least 70% of customers who experience our eSign feature should report being satisfied or very satisfied with their overall experience.</li>
                    <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 04.</span> Increase the engagement rate by at least 20% through providing a secure, easy-to-use, and smooth eSign experience.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h6 class="variant">My Process and Role</h6>
                   <p class="variant">
                    I followed a systematic approach to create and manage products, delivering value to customers 
                    and achieving business goals. In this project, I analyzed customer logs, conducted remote interviews, did competitive analysis, 
                    identified and prioritized feature requirements, worked with engineering, sales, and marketing teams, and defined KPIs for 
                    ongoing product development efforts.

            <h6>Understanding attorneys' current workflows in signing documents</h6>
            <p>To gain a better understanding of the current customers' document generation workflow, I first analyzed the interaction logs for nine attorneys using Lawyaw to gain 
                insights into their usage behavior. Then, I conducted remote interviews with these customers to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of their end-to-end process, 
                starting from document creation to the signing and sending of documents to their clients.
               Below, I visualized two different workflows our customers have for signing documents and forms.  </p>

                <h6 class="variant">Main findings:</h6>
                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> <mark>Time-consuming workflow:</mark> Attorneys have two options to sign client forms: upload files to external tools like DocuSign or sign them manually by printing. However, both ways are time-consuming since customers need to rely either on other tools or mail the documents.</li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Complicated and error-prone workflow:</mark> Our customers have reported that the process of downloading the documents and then uploading them to a different tool is complicated and error-prone. They face a risk of forgetting to upload a specific form, which can cause delays and errors.</li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Privacy and security concerns:</mark> Our customers have also expressed concern about constantly downloading and uploading files between different tools or mailing the documents, as they are uncomfortable with their clients' confidential information floating around.</li>
                </ul>
           </p>

            </p>

            <h6>User Persona</h6>
            To gain a deeper understanding of our target audience's goals, behaviors, motivations, pain points, and preferences, I created multiple user personas. 
            These personas helped the team to design a feature that meet users' needs, expectations, and desires. 
            User personas also help me to communicate with stakeholders by providing a shared understanding of the users we are designing for.

<!--     User-Friendly: The onboarding process should be easy to navigate, intuitive, and user-friendly. This means using simple language, clear instructions, and avoiding unnecessary steps.

    Personalization: Personalization of the onboarding experience can lead to higher engagement and retention. This can include personalized messages, suggestions, or recommendations based on the user's preferences, behavior, or profile.

    Clear expectations: The onboarding process should set clear expectations of what the user can expect from the product or service, and what they need to do to get started. This can include providing detailed instructions, FAQs, and best practices.

    Feedback: Providing feedback to the user during the onboarding process can help them understand how they are progressing, what they have accomplished, and what they need to do next. Feedback can also help users stay motivated and engaged.

    Self-Paced: Users should be able to progress through the onboarding process at their own pace, without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. Providing the option to skip certain steps or return to previous steps can also be helpful.

    Multi-Channel: Offering different channels to access onboarding resources can increase user adoption and retention. This can include tutorials, video guides, online help, and chatbots.

    Continuous improvement: Successful self-service onboarding should be an ongoing process. Gathering feedback from users and analyzing data can help identify areas for improvement, and ensure the onboarding process continues to meet the needs of users over time. -->
