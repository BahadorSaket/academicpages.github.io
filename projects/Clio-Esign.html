            <h6>Project Overview</h6>
            <p class="variant"> 
                <a href="https://www.lawyaw.com/" target="_blank" class="note-link">Lawyaw</a> is a powerful legal document automation software that simplifies the document creation process for attorneys. 
                As one of the services offered by the <a href="https://www.clio.com/" target="_blank" class="note-link">Clio</a> suite, Lawyaw has helped countless legal professionals streamline their workflow and save valuable time. <br><br>

                We identified our customers often rely on third-party e-signature solutions like DocuSign for signing their legal forms and documents, which can be costly and require moving documents to a different platform that break their workflow. 
                To address these challenges, legal professionals are seeking integrated e-signature solutions within Lawyaw software, to simplify the signing process, increase security, and improve efficiency. <br><br>

                During my time as a product manager at Clio, I worked with a cross-functional team to develop and launch an <a href="https://www.lawyaw.com/esignatures" target="_blank" class="note-link">eSign feature</a> with the Lawyaw platform. 
                With this new feature, attorneys and parallegals could easily drag and drop signature fields into their documents, making the eSign experience effortless and seamless.  <br><br>

                As a result of this project, we achieved <mark>54% adoption rate among existing customers and 67% among new customers</mark> for the eSign feature.
                In addition, on average <mark>3300 documents signed</mark> using our eSign feature each day. Finally, we <mark>increased engagement rates by at least 20% </mark>through providing a secure, easy-to-use, and smooth eSign experience. <br><br>

                <a href="https://www.lawyaw.com/esignatures" target="_blank" class="note-link">eSign feature</a> has already been launched and is being utilized by thousands of legal professionals all over the world.

            <h6>Customer and Market Research</h6>
            <p>To gain a better understanding of the current customers' workflow, I first analyzed the interaction logs for nine attorneys using Lawyaw to gain 
                insights into their usage behavior. Then, I conducted remote interviews with these customers to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of their end-to-end process, 
                starting from document creation to the signing and sending of documents to their clients.

                <h6><span>Customer Segmentation</span></h6>
                <p>Based on our initial meetings, customer interviews, and their interaction logs, we have categorized our customers into <mark>two primary segments</mark>.</p>

                After talking to our customers about their workflow, I was able to better visualize the signature process and understand our customers'

However, both ways are time-consuming since customers need to rely either on other tools or mail the documents.</li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Complicated and error-prone workflow:</mark> Our customers have reported that the process of downloading the documents and then uploading them to a different tool is complicated and error-prone.

                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Privacy and security concerns:</mark> Our customers have also expressed concern about constantly downloading and uploading files between different tools or mailing the documents, as they are uncomfortable with their clients' confidential information floating around.</li>

           </p>

           <h6><span>Competitive analysis of well-known eSign tools</span></h6>
           <p>I conducted competitive analysis of well-known eSign tools in the market, comparing their features, pricing, ease of use, security, and other relevant factors. 
            The helped me and the rest of the team in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and how they stack up against each other.

            <h6>User Persona</h6>
            To gain a deeper understanding of our target audience's goals, behaviors, motivations, pain points, and preferences, I created multiple user personas. 
            These personas helped the team to design a feature that meet users' needs, expectations, and desires. 
            User personas also help me to communicate with stakeholders by providing a shared understanding of the target users.

           To ensure that our final product meets the highest quality standards and satisfies the needs of our target audience, I facilitated a dogfooding session where every team member was asked to test the new onboarding process for three days. Moreover, to encourage thorough testing and bug reporting, I introduced a prize for the team member who identified the maximum number of unique bugs and issues. <br><br>

           This strategy served two crucial purposes: <strong>1)</strong> <mark>enabling team members to gain hands-on experience with the new feature</mark> and <strong>2)</strong><mark>providing valuable feedback and insights into potential issues or bugs, which allowed for proactive resolution before launch.</mark>

           <h6>Product Launch</h6>
           <p>To ensure that our new eSign feature was effective and ready for a wider release, 
            we conducted a trial with 12 new customers, gathering feedback and testing the product.  
            Additionally, I checked to ensure that the data we collected during the trial was properly stored in our databases. </p>

            <p>During our soft launch, we learned that many <mark>customers wished to save their signature settings for quick application to new documents</mark>. 
                This feature would reduce the time required for the signing process and provide customers with a more efficient and personalized experience. 
                Initially, we did not offer this feature, causing inconvenience to many customers who had to sign every time instead of using their previously created signature. </p>

<!--     User-Friendly: The onboarding process should be easy to navigate, intuitive, and user-friendly. This means using simple language, clear instructions, and avoiding unnecessary steps.

    Personalization: Personalization of the onboarding experience can lead to higher engagement and retention. This can include personalized messages, suggestions, or recommendations based on the user's preferences, behavior, or profile.

    Clear expectations: The onboarding process should set clear expectations of what the user can expect from the product or service, and what they need to do to get started. This can include providing detailed instructions, FAQs, and best practices.

    Feedback: Providing feedback to the user during the onboarding process can help them understand how they are progressing, what they have accomplished, and what they need to do next. Feedback can also help users stay motivated and engaged.

    Self-Paced: Users should be able to progress through the onboarding process at their own pace, without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. Providing the option to skip certain steps or return to previous steps can also be helpful.

    Multi-Channel: Offering different channels to access onboarding resources can increase user adoption and retention. This can include tutorials, video guides, online help, and chatbots.

    Continuous improvement: Successful self-service onboarding should be an ongoing process. Gathering feedback from users and analyzing data can help identify areas for improvement, and ensure the onboarding process continues to meet the needs of users over time. -->
